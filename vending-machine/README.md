# SCADA System for a Food and Beverage Vending Machine

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a SCADA-based control system for a food and beverage vending machine, designed around simple and intuitive user interaction.

The vending machine operates by first displaying a list of available food and beverage items along with their prices. The purchase process is initiated by pressing a START button, after which the user inserts the desired amount of money (banknotes up to 500 RSD) and selects a product using the corresponding selection buttons.

Once the product is selected and sufficient funds are provided, the vending machine dispenses the item through the lower delivery compartment. The system also manages change return, allowing the user to either collect the remaining balance or proceed with another purchase.
